# Sirokko 262.01 controller

> **DRAFT / NOT FOR ORDER / NO POWER / NO FIRE.** The board is unfinished and has not passed manufacturing or physical acceptance. Do not order it, power it, or connect it to a burner.

The working tree contains one current, complete KiCad project:

- project: [`hardware/kicad/Sirokko26201_control_motor_candidate.kicad_pro`](hardware/kicad/Sirokko26201_control_motor_candidate.kicad_pro);
- schematic: [`hardware/kicad/Sirokko26201_control_motor_candidate.kicad_sch`](hardware/kicad/Sirokko26201_control_motor_candidate.kicad_sch);
- PCB: [`hardware/kicad/Sirokko26201_control_motor_candidate.kicad_pcb`](hardware/kicad/Sirokko26201_control_motor_candidate.kicad_pcb);
- current corrected after63 PCB SHA-256: `f0cbceafcff1f6845bc850b090935e0a5f719f1fe8f087e952177cfb92e8722f`.

After20, after30, after34, after42, after52 and after55 were published sequentially on top of cleanup. The current PCB preserves all 1,776 after55 objects by UUID, net, layer and geometry and adds exactly seven 0.25 mm segments and two 0.6/0.3 mm vias. The rejected diagonal GND segment was replaced by two segments; the new `copper_sliver` is gone. See [`docs/CURRENT_STATE_RU.md`](docs/CURRENT_STATE_RU.md).

The revoked bare-TFT M2×12 fastener model has been removed. The official nominal Waveshare 18366 STEP remains, but the factory standoff thread and height, mating hardware and full Z-stack are not accepted.

There is no firmware in the working tree. The former bench implementation was rejected as a basis for the final product and remains available in Git history. New firmware must wait for final PCB and pin-map acceptance. No ILI9341 driver is currently implemented.

Current instructions and evidence:

- [`README_RU.md`](README_RU.md) — primary Russian entry point;
- [`docs/REQUIREMENTS_RU.md`](docs/REQUIREMENTS_RU.md) — requirements;
- [`docs/CURRENT_STATE_RU.md`](docs/CURRENT_STATE_RU.md) — current revision and limitations;
- [`hardware/kicad/README.md`](hardware/kicad/README.md) — project entry points and dependencies;
- [`verification/current/README_RU.md`](verification/current/README_RU.md) — fresh verification log.

Historical CAD copies, WIP candidates, superseded instructions and the old firmware were removed from the current tree; normal Git history remains the recovery path.
